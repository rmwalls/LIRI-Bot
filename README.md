# LIRI-Bot
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This App is the result of a homework assignment during UNC-Charlotte's Web Coding BootCamp in summer of 2019. The main point being to learn to use the technologies and practices listed below. Other than consulting with classmates on an issue or two where I got stuck, this app is the result of my own work.
